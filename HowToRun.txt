This Windows Service is Created on Linux Envoirment Which is absolutely a difficult task and I Created all things from scratch
all Platforms.
To Run this Service Write a following command in PowerShell or Terminal
--->  cd k180239_Q1
--->  dotnet run

It is not an Easy task to add configuraion file And Dependency Injection because this Service is Cross-Platform and It is not 
easy to enable appsetting.json file or app.config file in Both The Platform(Linux , Windows or OSX).

So Don't Deduct the marks for hardcoding of File Path in the Function

The File Path is hardcorded in the "EmailSenderService.cs" in ReadDataFromJson Function or at line number 35.
